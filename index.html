Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <li>Go to the game, and make the most of being there. Watch closely. Take notes. Keep track of important plays, scores, and statistics. Take note of interesting details, such as how the players celebrated at the end or the feel of the crowd that night.
</li>
              <li>Local sporting events are a good place to start for an aspiring sportswriter. You’ll find passionate fans/parents, eager participants, and a good environment for covering a sporting event from several angles.
</li>
              <li>Talk to people there. Even if you are writing an event recap and not a personal interest story, a few good sound bites or a central figure to build the article around can only help.
</li>
              <li>Contact coaches to see if they have a player who would make a good story. Watch the subject play the game, and set up a brief interview. Figure out what makes his or her story distinctive.
</li>
              <li>Talk to players and coaches to get quotes about the game. Even asking boilerplate questions like “What contributed to you winning the game?” will give you some material with which to work.
</li>
              <li>Ask permission to record your interviews. Also, try talking to people close to the person, such as parents and friends to create a well rounded view of the person.

              <p>Even if you aren’t on an editor’s word count, one of the essential goals of all journalism, including sports writing, is to say as much as possible in as few words as possible. Even if you aren’t restrained by the space needs of a newspaper and are publishing online, your readers will appreciate it if you get to the point quickly. Use shorter sentences instead of longer ones.

              <p>Sports writing can sometimes get a bad rap as a lesser form of journalism, but some of the best writers and writing today and historically have covered sports. Hemingway famously wrote about bullfighting, and more recently, one of novelist David Foster Wallace’s most remembered pieces was about tennis star Roger Federer. Don’t sell yourself or your readers short, even if you are covering a youth soccer game. Those kids are giving their best, and so should you.
